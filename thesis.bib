  abstract = {Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of
	a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation
	averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and
	does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions
	are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and
	using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data
	sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection
	in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains
	in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction
	method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes
	in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},

  abstract = {For physical activity recognition, smartphone sensors, such as an
	accelerometer and a gyroscope, are being utilized in many research
	studies. So far, particularly, the accelerometer has been extensively
	studied. In a few recent studies, a combination of a gyroscope, a
	magnetometer (in a supporting role) and an accelerometer (in a lead
	role) has been used with the aim to improve the recognition performance.
	How and when are various motion sensors, which are available on a
	smartphone, best used for better recognition performance, either
	individually or in combination? This is yet to be explored. In order
	to investigate this question, in this paper, we explore how these
	various motion sensors behave in different situations in the activity
	recognition process. For this purpose, we designed a data collection
	experiment where ten participants performed seven different activities
	carrying smart phones at different positions. Based on the analysis
	of this data set, we show that these sensors, except the magnetometer,
	are each capable of taking the lead roles individually, depending
	on the type of activity being recognized, the body position, the
	used data features and the classification method employed (personalized
	or generalized). We also show that their combination only improves
	the overall recognition performance when their individual performances
	are not very high, so that there is room for performance improvement.
	We have made our data set and our data collection application publicly
	available, thereby making our experiments reproducible.},
